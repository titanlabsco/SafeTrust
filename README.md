<h1> SafeTrust </h1>
	
<h1> Introduction: </h1>

is a secure platform designed to facilitate apartment rentals while safeguarding tenants' deposit money. 
By leveraging trustless technology, SafeTrust addresses critical challenges in building trust between renters and property owners, especially when transactions involve cryptocurrency payments. Since crypto payments are final and irreversible, there’s an increased risk of fraud or non-delivery of services. SafeTrust mitigates this by providing a trustless environment, ensuring that deposits and payments are protected without relying on traditional chargebacks or payment reversals, creating a safer and more reliable rental experience.
